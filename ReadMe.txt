This is the supplementary code for our paper:
*********************************************
*Shape similarity assessment based on partial feature aggregation and ranking lists
*Submitted to Pattern Recognition Letters for Review
*Contact: Zhenzhong Kuang(zzkuang@foxmail.com)
*
*Version: v1
*2/15/2016

Software: MATLAB
(1) Run "Demo_MSC_ELDF.m", you can extract MSC+ELDF shape feature
   The results will be save in result folder (Note that all the shape are downsamped to 2000 faces).

(2) Run "Demo_PA_Encoding.m", you can encode MSC+ELDF
    At the same time, your can see the evaluation results.

(3) Run "Demo_PML_SimilarityReEvaluation.m", you can re-evaluate the results by metric learning
    At the same time, your can see the evaluation results.

Please do not distribute the code before acceptance. 
If there are any problems, please email us (zzkuang@foxmail.com). Thanks.
After this version, an optimized version will be released soon (All the codes will be available)!
